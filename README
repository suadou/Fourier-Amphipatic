FOURIER-POWER-SPECTRUM-OF-HYDROPHOBICITIES
==========================================

PURPOSE:

This is a graphical python program to obtain the Fourier power spectrum of
hydrophibicities from an amino acid sequence.

It was developed by Sergio Suarez-Dou from University of Oviedo, Spain. 

REQUIREMENTS:

Python 3.6 or later. To get python check this web site: https://www.python.org/

Package dependencies: PyQT5, numpy, matplotlib and biopython. 

The files in the folder "tables" contains files of the hydrophobicity scales
obtained by differents authors (Eisenberg, Kyte-Doolittle, Chothia, Janin,
Tanford, von Heijne-Blomberg, Wimley and Wolfenden).

These tables can be modified and other added, but this would require modifying
the script.

INSTALLATION:

To install the package, from the folder containing this package, type on the
command line:

	python -m pip install -r REQUIREMENTS.txt
or
	python3 -m pip install -r REQUIREMENTS.txt

The pip package is required for first-time installation
(see https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)

RUNNING THE SCRIPT:

Type on the command line:

	python Application-[linux or IOs or Windows].py
Or
	python3 Application-[linux or IOs or Windows].py

On unix systems, you also may give execution privileges to Application.py,
en just type

        Application.py

USAGE RECOMMENDATIONS:

We recommend to apply this method to a sequence from 200 to 500 amino acid.
Longer sequences lead to lower definition and less sensibility.

The default window size is 25 amino acid, and we recommend it to be between
15 and 25 amino acid.

The hydrophobicity plot uses a sliding window of 15 amino acid, widely
extended in many publications. This value can be changed in the script file.

TESTING FILES:

The accompanying amino acid sequence files in FASTA format allow to reproduce
the illustrations provided on the paper, and can be used for testing purposes.
